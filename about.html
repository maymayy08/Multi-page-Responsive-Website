          Greetings! I'm May and I first learned how to make origami from my mum when I was 13, who have introduced me to the world of art. I remember when she first learn how to make orgami,
        I would always sitting beside her and watching her in awe as she effortlessly transformed a piece a paper into a crane or a rose with just a few precise folds. 
        <br><br>
        To save time, I would always help her to fold pieces of paper to speed up things faster.  
        She taught me that making origami wasn't just about following the steps; but it was about embracing the process and paying attention to details.  
        Therefore, I myself have decided to take on challenge what I have learned from her and take it from there.
        <br><br> 
        Few months later, I decided to gift my creations to close familys and friends and they was amazed how everything is just out of paper!
