            "Hi there! I'm May!, a passionate home cook who believes that food is not just fuel but a way to connect with people, culture, and memories. 
            <br><br>
            My love for cooking started from watching my mum, a trip abroad, experimenting in the kitchen and through youtube channel and has grown into a lifelong adventure in the kitchen. 
            <br><br>
            Whether I'm crafting traditional Asian dishes passed down through generations or experimenting with new flavors, cooking is my way of expressing creativity and sharing joy. 
            <br><vr></vr>
            I love exploring the endless variety of cuisines, and I'm always excited to try new recipes and techniques, especially when they bring a bit of comfort and warmth to the table. 
            When I'm not cooking, you'll find me researching new culinary trends or spending time with loved ones over a hearty meal.
